This started in a bored doodle of a more cartoonish bird, but I decided to add some colour and kinda just wanted to throw some paint around, which I ended up doing in a more literal sense. I've never done things in this sort of style before and I've got to say, I rather like it."

At least it's sort of passable in looks, despite the dodgy scan making the contrast go all funny."
