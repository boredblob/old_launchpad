## Stuff I need to remember because I keep forgetting how to fix the error

- Draggable objects reset their position after initial touch (or small amount of movement) on mobile - have you set a touch-action for the area?

## To-do

- [x] Database supports pages rather than single images.
- [x] Gallery supports multiple images per page.
- [x] Add light theme
- [ ] Add sketchbook drawings to database. (Digitally redo bad apple).
- [ ] Use `navigator.connection.effectiveType` and `navigator.connection.saveData` to optimise gallery and other features for lower data consumption.
- [ ] ~~Only load source code when button is clicked.~~ *(I give up with this)*

## Back-end

All pages are static, though javascript is used to dynamically load the pages. This is done by way of fetching data from a json file, containing details of images and their captions and things.
